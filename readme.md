# stencil-aframe

This is a failed solution attempt for trying to get Angular binding working with A-Frame.  
The idea was to wrap A-Frame in a web components and then use the components from Angular.  

The wanted result of using  Stencil web components in Angular is demoed in this repo: [seveves/angular-stencil](https://github.com/seveves/angular-stencil)  

More info in [inner readme](stencil-aframe/readme.md)

The End.
